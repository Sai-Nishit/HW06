# Stock Exchange Visualization

## Dataset Information
-> What dataset did you use? The dataset used is the Stock Exchange dataset provided by the course materials.

-> Why did you choose this dataset? I chose this dataset because it provides historical stock data that includes key metrics like high, low, and close prices. These metrics are well-suited for visualizing trends over time and understanding market behavior.

-> Which fields/features/parameters of the dataset did you use? The fields used in the visualization are:

Date: Represents the date of the stock entry.
High: The highest price of the stock on that date.
Low: The lowest price of the stock on that date.
Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.

->How many data points did you use? The dataset contains thousands of records spanning several decades. The exact number depends on the dataset provided but includes records from 1986 to 2021.

## Visualization Details
->What are you visualizing? How do the shapes, colors, or movement relate to the data values?

The visualization plots the stock's high and low prices using vertical lines for each date, representing the range of price fluctuations.
The closing prices are plotted as red dots to highlight the final price of the stock for the day.
The x-axis represents the date, and the y-axis represents the stock price.
The choice of red for the closing prices emphasizes significant market activity.

-> Include drawings and images of reference visualizations.
